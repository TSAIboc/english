00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Thing online about possible changes proposed by nominees for president elect Trump's cabinet

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,766
One of those changes will be to tap water

3
00:00:07,833 --> 00:00:12,266
Sheryl Mercedes explains why the proposal is already causing some backlash

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:22,433
Why has the nomination of Robert Kennedy Jr as the head of health and Human Services sparked a new debate about fluoride in drinking water

5
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:29,666
RFK Jr has said he will advise local water systems to remove fluoride from public drinking water?

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:38,433
According to the centers for Disease Control close to 63 percent of Americans have a fluoridated water coming out of their taps.

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,466
Local municipalities make the decision whether or not to add fluoride to the water supply.

8
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:49,633
The US Environmental Protection Agency only mandates a limit on how much can be put in.

9
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:56,366
So what is fluoride? It is a naturally occurring mineral that is already found in some water supplies.

10
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:59,400
That's actually how we discovered it helped teeth

11
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:06,333
Dentists noticed that people living in areas with fluoride in the water had less tooth decay and better enamel.

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,400
In 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan became the first city in the world to add fluoride to its water supply

13
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,466
Research shows the rate of cavities and children there decreased by more than 60 percent.

14
00:01:20,066 --> 00:01:24,900
The debate over fluoride stems from what happens when there is too much in the water

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,033
A recent scientific paper found a possible link between high fluoride levels and lower IQs in children

16
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,800
but those fluoride levels were double what is recommended by the ETA.

17
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:44,200
Exports say more research is needed and warned that facts, not conspiracy theories should inform that debate.
